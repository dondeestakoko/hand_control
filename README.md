# hand_control

Greetings, People 
So, where do I start? I've had some free time lately, and with nothing much to do, I decided to dive into something I've always been curious about—controlling everything with a camera and simple gestures, like in the movies. With my low-end PC, I trained a YOLO model using my own data, which I created and labeled with Roboflow.
The results were satisfying for me at least. I kept it as minimalistic as possible, and I can already imagine its future use. I know similar technologies exist, but I enjoy the idea of creating and using it myself. One small step for man (me), as they say.
This video contains a demo. Sorry for the bugs—my i5 is starting to slow down.
